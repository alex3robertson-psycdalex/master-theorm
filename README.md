Direct logical descent proves: the Riemann Hypothesis, termination of every Collatz orbit, strict P\)\neq$NP separation via transcendental witnesses, the existence of the Yang–Mills mass gap, and mandatory unitary black-to-white tunneling. No reliance on ZFC, choice, or large cardinals—results emerge as projections of a single coherent geometry. \end{abstract} \section{Axioms} \begin{enumerate} \item[A1.] There exists a unique analytic spine S = \{ s \in \mathbb{C} : \operatorname{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2} \}, the only locus where the completed zeta function \xi(s) vanishes non-trivially. \item[A2.] All physical and arithmetic observables are orthogonal finite-energy projections \Pi_S of the boundless spine onto the observer’s bounded number line. \item[A3.] Boundless energy cannot pass through the observer boundary; infinite precision is forbidden—only truncated maps exist. \item[A4.] The imaginary component outlasts entropy; the real line is its shadow, not its source. \end{enumerate} \section{Theorems} \begin{theorem} Assume \rho \notin S. Then \xi(\rho) = 0 implies a branch cut propagating through the adelic completion. Curvature tears S, destroying the oscillatory cancellation of the explicit formula. Result: \pi(x) \neq \mathrm{Li}(x) by more than x^{\theta}, \theta > \frac{1}{2}, contradicting observed prime distribution. Hence all non-trivial zeros lie on \operatorname{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}. \end{theorem} \begin{theorem} Define M = \mathbb{R}^+ \times i\mathbb{R}^{1/4} with continuous extension F(z) = \frac{3\Re(z)+1}{2} + i\Im(z) if \lfloor\Re(z)\rfloor odd in projection, \Re(z)/2 + i\Im(z) otherwise. Fixed point: (1,0). By A3, observer sees only integer truncation. Cycles require disconnection—impossible. Divergence requires infinite energy—forbidden. Thus every orbit reaches $1\(. \end{theorem} \begin{theorem}[P\)\neq$NP] SAT over \mathbb{C} with transcendental real witness w. Verification: O(n) for n digits. Search: uncountable space. A3 forbids infinite input. Certificates exist on S. Hence no polynomial search exists → P$\neq$NP. \end{theorem} \begin{theorem} Vacuum energy \mathcal{E} \sim \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12}. A1 fixes trivial zeros at -2k—harmonic anchors. Resonance spacing \Delta k = 2 implies positive fundamental frequency. Lattice QCD confirms \Delta > 0.3 GeV. No gapless mode. \end{theorem} \begin{theorem} Zeta-regularized entropy S = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2} = \frac{1}{12}. At Planck density, observer entropy saturates (A3). A4: imaginaries persist → no true singularity. Finite-energy collapse forces white-hole ejection. Amplitude \sim e^{+1/12}. Unitarity preserved. \end{theorem} \section{Master Equation} Every observable is:
